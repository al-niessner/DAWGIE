        Otherwise, use parameter.<key> to constrain the sublists to be produced.

        The return value is list of strings. If reducing filtering for run id,
        then the list will always be 0..1 strings. If 0, then no match. If 1,
        then it be first:last+1 even if the indices are not continuous.

        The return strings will be in runid order. For large lists, use the
        pagination index and limit. Each page will require a new DB search
        as no caching is done for simplicity reasons. Hence large searches
        are expensive.
