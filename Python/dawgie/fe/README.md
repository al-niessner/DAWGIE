# Available Endpoints

Describes the REST API (endpoints) that DAWGIE provides to access the data it manages. The endpoints are documented as:

```
Name (Get/Post)
   Inputs
   Outputs
```

Each endpoint begins with `/app`, short for application, to identify the REST API that can be programatically accessed. These endpoints are different than the endpoints that return fixed pages like /pages/index.html that is the front page.
